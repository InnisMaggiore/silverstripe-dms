# Document Management System Cart Module

You can now request a hard-copy of preconfigured documents using the [DMS Cart Module](https://github.com/creative-commoners/silverstripe-dms-cart). The Cart Module is similar to a shopping cart and allows multiple documents to be requested in print form. This is an optional installation to enhance your DMS.
