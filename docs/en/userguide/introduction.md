# Introduction

The Document Management System (DMS) is a way to organise related documents into sets, either through manually creating links between documents or through utilising tags and other key criteria already placed on a Document. Sets of similar documents are called Document Sets. This module provides an easy way to create, maintain and manage Document Sets as well as individual documents included in each set.

This guide will show you how to create a Document Set manually or by using our Query Builder tool that can create a set of multiple documents with just a few clicks.

Once created, Document Sets can be added to your pages to display "Related documents", providing supporting documents or relevant information.
